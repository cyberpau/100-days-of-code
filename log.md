# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Weeks ago, I started completing several LinkedIn courses on the DevOps Engineer learning path. Today is a general review and tinkering on what I learned on the past weeks.

**Thoughts:** I suggest to read the resources on each courses, and do the activities hands-on. After that, try to tinker and customize the codes.

### Day 2: April 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode - I finished another LinkedIn Course "Learning Docker" by Arthur Ulfeldt. I also started coding a small Java program for file search using Visual Studio Code instead of my usual Eclipse IDE. 

**Thoughts:** I have not coded Java for a long time, so it took me some time getting back to shape. I used VS Code instead of Eclipse IDE in order to standardized my tools. It also took a while to learn the Java Extension Pack and it's usage like generating getter/setter etc.

### Day 3: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode - continued my simple Java file search project and renamed it to "search-raptor". Also attended Ministry of Testing PH meetup about Exploratory Testing.

**Thoughts:** Encountered some file exceptions error and it took me some time to figure it out that it is as designed - empty directories get permission error when trying to read unlike files.
