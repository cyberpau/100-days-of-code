# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Weeks ago, I started completing several LinkedIn courses on the DevOps Engineer learning path. Today is a general review and tinkering on what I learned on the past weeks.

**Thoughts:** I suggest to read the resources on each courses, and do the activities hands-on. After that, try to tinker and customize the codes.
